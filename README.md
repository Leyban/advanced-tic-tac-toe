# ADVANCED TIC TAC TOE APP

## About
This is a tic tac toe react app with extra features of coin sizes where you can place a coin on another coin with smaller value. 

## How it Works
There are five(5) components in this app.
    Header
    Player Deck 1
    Game Board
    Player Deck 2
    Footer

This app utilizes context hooks to communicate with each other.
When a player selects a coin, it checks if the player's turn is correct.
When a player adds a coin in the board, it saves the coin on state hook to check for validity and if the game should end.

## Inspiration
I saw a small clip of a board game like this one and I didn't want to buy it.
